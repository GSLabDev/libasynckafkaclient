class `ProduceResponse`
=======================

**Header File:** `<libkafka_asio/produce_response.h>`

**Namespace:** `libkafka_asio`

Implementation of the Kafka ProduceResponse as described on the 
[Kafka wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/A+Guide+To+The+Kafka+Protocol#AGuideToTheKafkaProtocol-ProduceResponse).
An object of this type will be given as response object to the handler function
when invoking a produce request and the request expected the server to send a
response (which is not always the case for a ProduceRequest).
